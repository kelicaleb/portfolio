                        I have various skills that I am blessed with. My skills are; <ol>
                          <Li>
                            Playing football

                          <li>
                            Playing chess
                          </li>
                        </ol><h1>Football</h1>
                        I love football as it help me exercise while having fun. I play at the wing position where it allows me to have enough space to dribble and put effective crosses for the finisher to score goals 
                        . On to my second skill
                        <h1>Chess</h1>
                        Luck is when preparation meets opportunity. Is it a game of luck? As you can tell from the background its a game I love . Its a game that helps my mental health, decision making and critical thinking . Its a game that ironically has helped me  to see the world as grey and not as black and white . Its a game that brings king Solomon back to life for it is a laungage he spoke fluently . Its a skill I attained at high school and ever since, my mind did not fall in love but rose in love. If you want to venture and battle me on online you can find me in chess.com and liches at <em>bluehorizon</em>

                        <p>"Don't adjust your set. That is not is a graphical error. That is the actual scorline. The kings of comeback in this special Sunday contest and this the right time for the devil to beg for forgiveness" That was my favourite line from  Peter as my team rivals were being humuliated , more so he combined my hobbies . Watching football and reading poems .</p>
